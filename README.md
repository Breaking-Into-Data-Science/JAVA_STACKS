Self study notes (welcome to tell me more i don't know :) )

JAVA programming - Data Structures "STACKS"
Data Structures can be used for organizing multiple data efficiently.

**STACK!! BEGIN

Three main operations or methods: (thinking the example as plates)
1. Push : put the new plate on the top of the stack of plates
2. Pop  : take away the plate from the stake of plates
3. Peep : Just LOOK at the top element without remove it
